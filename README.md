                                                    **# Expense-Management**

Introduction:
      **Expense Management Wants to totally take the stress out of sharing Expenses and Creating IOUs
      with Friends. A huge Part of that is Facilitating Communication Around Who Owes Who, and
      for What. We‟re always looking for new ways to help you and your Friends get (and stay!) on
      the Same Page.
      That‟s why we‟re so excited to Announce the Release of Expense Comments for the Web. This
      New Feature will let Group Members and Friends have Conversations within the Web App
      around Individual Expenses. We Plan to Bring Expense Comments to our I-phone and Android
      Apps in the New Year, so you Can Sort stuff out on-the-go, too.
      In the Expanded View you‟ll now see a „Notes and Comments‟ box with a „Post‟ button beneath.
      Simply add Your Questions and Thoughts to the Box, hit „Post‟, and await your Buddy‟s
      Response! We‟ve added an Email Notification Setting for this Feature; you can choose to get an
      Email every time someone adds a Comment to an Expense you‟re on. Head to Your Profile
      Settings Page („Your Account‟) to Toggle.
      As always, we‟re Thrilled to be steadily Improving Expense Management, and so Grateful that
      you‟re here for the Journey. Happy Holidays!**
